# INFO2222 Assignment 1, a simplistic website using python bottle focusing on security (done in pairs) - *WORK IN PROGRESS*

My first assignment in full stack development

Template provided - Most coding was done in run.py, model.py, sql.py, controller.py

In /static directory:
/js/keyjen.js, /css/chat.css, /html/validlogin.html, /html/chatencode.html all written from scratch

Before running the program, refer to requirements.txt for all required python libraries

Use: python3 run.py

For more information refer to INFO2222 Assignment 1 Report.pdf for information on the current security features of the website .
